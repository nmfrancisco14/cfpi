## Why We Need a Floor Price

- During **harvest time**, palay prices often **drop sharply**, leaving farmers with low income.  
- Rising **costs of fertilizer, fuel, and labor** make it hard to recover from price declines.  
- **Executive Order No. 100 (2025)** directs the government to set a **minimum or “floor” price** to protect farmers.  
- But **when** should we trigger this floor price?  
  → That’s where the **Composite Floor Price Index (CFPI)** helps.

## What is the CFPI?

- The **CFPI** is a **summary number** that combines many signals affecting palay prices.  
- It acts like an **“early warning system”** — showing when the market is likely to drop below fair value.  
- When the CFPI goes **above a certain level**, it signals that government action (like procurement or support) may be needed.

## The Idea Behind It

The CFPI pulls together information from different parts of the rice market:

1. **Prices** – farmgate and retail  
2. **Production Costs** – fertilizer, fuel, etc.  
3. **Supply Factors** – area harvested, imports, rainfall  
4. **Global Trends** – world rice prices  

Each of these indicators contributes to how risky or safe the situation is for farmers.

## The CFPI Equation (Simplified)

$$
CFPI = w_1 X_1 + w_2 X_2 + ... + w_{10} X_{10}
$$

Where each **X** is an indicator (like farmgate price or fertilizer cost), and each **w** is its importance or weight.

👉 A **higher CFPI** means farmers are **more at risk** of price drops.

## Sample Indicators {.smaller}


| Category | Example Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|------------------|----------|
| Farm Prices | Farmgate Price | Lower than usual → warning sign |
| Costs | Fertilizer, Fuel | Rising → lower profit for farmers |
| Supply | Damaged Area | Less harvest → possible shortage |
| Trade | Import Volume | High imports → more market pressure |
| Climate | Rainfall | Too much or too little → affects yield |

## Example (Simplified) {.smaller}

Suppose we give **equal weight (0.1)** to 10 indicators:

| Indicator | Value Change | Weighted Effect |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| Farm price ↓ | -0.05 | -0.005 |
| Profit ↓ | -0.10 | -0.010 |
| Retail price stable | 0.00 | 0.000 |
| Price gap ↑ | +0.02 | +0.002 |
| Harvest area ↓ | -0.03 | -0.003 |
| Fertilizer cost ↑ | +0.08 | +0.008 |
| Fuel cost ↑ | +0.04 | +0.004 |
| Rainfall excess | +0.02 | +0.002 |
| Imports ↑ | +0.05 | +0.005 |
| Global price ↓ | -0.06 | -0.006 |

## Adding Them Up {.smaller}

$$
\begin{aligned}
CFPI = &(-0.005 -0.010 + 0.000 + 0.002 -0.003) \\
       &+ (0.008 + 0.004 + 0.002 + 0.005 -0.006) \\
       &= -0.003
\end{aligned}
$$

✅ Result: **-0.003** means the market is **stable** for now.  
⚠️ If it were **above 0.05**, that would signal a **trigger** for support.

## How to Read CFPI Values

| CFPI Value | Meaning | Suggested Action |
|-------------|----------|------------------|
| **< -0.05** | Stable | No action needed |
| **-0.05 to 0.05** | Watch | Monitor closely |
| **> 0.05** | Trigger | Implement floor price |

---

## Why It Matters

- Helps **anticipate** market downturns before they hurt farmers.  
- Makes floor price decisions **data-driven** instead of reactive.  
- Encourages **transparent** and **evidence-based** policymaking.
